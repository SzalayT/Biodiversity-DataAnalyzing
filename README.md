# Biodiversity-DataAnalyzing

The goal of this project is to analyze biodiversity data from the National Parks Service, particularly around various species observed in different national park locations.

Project scoop:
*What is the distribution of conservation status for species?
*Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?
*Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?
*Which animal is most prevalent and what is their distribution amongst parks?


Data sources:

Both Observations.csv and Species_info.csv was provided by Codecademy.com.

Note: The data for this project is inspired by real data, but is mostly fictional.
